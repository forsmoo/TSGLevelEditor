These are two examples of how to setup a rail.

1. At the topmost level in the hierarchy add a RailDefinition.
2. Add capsule colliders as child objects, these will be converted to when loaded into the game
 a) If there are multiple parts to the rail, these needs to sorted in the hierarchy in z-axis
3. You can also add a visual representation like in the examples, but this is not necessary
